# LLM-Fine-Tuning-RAG
This project intends to improve the effectiveness of promotional efforts by integrating powerful AI capabilities for Amharic text manipulation, in particular creating an Amharic RAG pipeline that will help generate Amharic-based creative text Ad content given campaign information such as brief (brand and product information) and the content history of a telegram channel

Collecting large-scale data for a  low-resource language and retraining an LLM can be prohibitively expensive due to computational and data collection costs. A better approach is transfer learning; transferring an LLMâ€™s capabilities from English to a non-English language through further pre-training and fine-tuning.

# Run RAG
